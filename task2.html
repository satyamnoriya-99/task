            <h1>About the Book </h1>
            <p>[The Ramayana is a Sanskrit epic from ancient India, one of the two important epics of Hinduism known as the Itihasas, the other being the Mahābhārata.[4] The epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life of Rama, a prince of Ayodhya in the kingdom of Kosala.]</p>
        <h1>why I Love It</h1>
        <p>[The Ramayana is a very entertaining story, but there's also a lot of wise adages scattered throughout. Here are just a few that have stuck with me: “Rama, demons do not love men, therefore men must love each other.” “Princess, war is within us, it's nothing outside.”] </p>
